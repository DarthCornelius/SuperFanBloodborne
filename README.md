# SuperFanBloodborne
Using CodeSandbox I created the greatest SuperFan project in DaVinci History. To do this I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in order to create a beautiful masterpiece of web design that showcases my love of Bloodborne. This site is a mock tour guide for the different parts of Bloodborne's famous city of Yharnam. Attached in this repository are the links to my feedback and process slides so that you can look into the mid of a genius.
